        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p id="me" class="descriptions">
            I am an aspiring software engineer. I recently graduated from the University of Maryland with a B.S in Computer Science and a minor in Korean Language Studies. I'm a Korean American who was born and raised in Maryland.
            <br><br>
            My journey with computer science officially started in high school. I started off by taking intro computer science courses throughout high school. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of coding and decided to continue with CS in college.
            My coursework started with Java and then extended to Python, C, Ruby, Rust, OCaml, Racket, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Kotlin. I found my passion in front end engineering and design. 
            Throughout my first two years of college, I was in the Design Cultures and Creativity honors college. Here, I learned to design for the user and keeping accessibility in mind. My interest in UI/UX design began to grow here. Some of these projects can be found HERE.
            <br><br>
            I believe that my hardworking, passionate, and communicative characteristics strengthened during my time as president for the Korean Student Association. I learned to work with others as well as delegate work when I am in a leadership postion.
            Working with others not in tech or computer science has helped me to understand multiple perspectives and backgrounds. I am able to adapt quickly in various environments and take initiative when needed.
            <br><br>
            Overall, I am interested in user-centered design and front-end design. Through my career, I would like to eventually work to bridge the gap of accessibility and ableism through Human Computer Interaction, UI/UX design.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not working, I enjoy spending my time by staying creative. You can often find me attempting to edit videos, remaking thrifted clothes, and watching shows.<br>
            Thanks for reading a bit about me!
