        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p id="me" class="descriptions">
            Hi! My name is Min Jang and I am a Korean American who was born and raised in Maryland. 
            <br>I recently graduated from the University of Maryland with a B.S in Computer Science and a minor in Korean Language Studies.
            <br><br>
            My journey with computer science officially started in high school. I started off by taking intro computer science courses throughout high school. 
            <br>I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of coding and decided to continue with CS in college.
            <br>My coursework started with Java and then extended to Python, C, Ruby, Rust, OCaml, Racket, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Kotlin. 
            <br>I found my passion in front-end engineering and design. 
            Throughout my first two years of college, I was in the Design Cultures and Creativity honors college. Here, I learned to design for the user and keeping accessibility in mind. My interest in UI/UX design began to grow here. Some of these projects can be found <a href="https://min-jang.github.io/projects">on this page.</a>
            I was hoping to also minor in disability studies in an effort to learn more about accessibility and inclusivity as an able-bodied engineer/designer. However, I was not able to fully continue through with the minor. I do still hold interest in learning more about what I can do to advocate for change and minimizing the ableist mindset in the technological field.
            <br><br>
            I believe that my hardworking, passionate, and communicative characteristics strengthened during my time as president for the Korean Student Association. I learned to work with others as well as delegate work when I am in a leadership postion.
            Working with others not in tech or computer science has helped me to understand multiple perspectives and backgrounds. I am able to adapt quickly in various environments and take initiative when needed.
            <br><br>
            Overall, I am interested in user-centered design and front-end design. Through my career, I would like to eventually work to bridge the gap of accessibility and ableism through Human Computer Interaction, UI/UX design.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not working, I enjoy spending my time by staying creative. You can often find me attempting to edit videos, remaking thrifted clothes, and watching shows.<br>
            Thanks for reading a bit about me!
