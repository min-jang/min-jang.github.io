                            Using multiple pre-existing datasets, I analyzed the living costs and incomes for 45+ states in the United States.
                            The living costs were analyzed based on family structure (one adult or two adults -- only one working or both working).
                            The datasets were cleaned based on what was needed for this specific analysis.
                            Graphs were made to help visualize poverty rates by state, living wage by state and family structure, and a combination of the both.

                            The application focuses mainly on allowing people who use ankle-foot orthoses and wrist braces to customize the visual appearance of their devices.
                            It offers people with physical disabilities a chance to visualize what their ankle-foot orthoses or wrist braces given the patterns available.

                            A functional prototype of an application that can be used in the kitchen. This was built as a group project with three other members. 
                            The prototype went through multiple iterative stages to make sure that it was designed for the intended audience and remained accessible for all. 
                            Users may add food items as they are bought and categorize each item by food category. There is an "Expiring Soon" page that allows users to view any food items that may be expiring within the set time frame. 
                            Users may also look up food recipes as needed. This repository is <b>private</b> however, a writeup from one of the phases is linked below.

                            The user can also track their history of workouts and also add any workouts that they complete. All data is stored in MongoDB according to each user.

                            This was my first attempt at using Adobe XD and prototyping an existing application. 
                            In this class, we were given the prompt: "Redesign the Metro Kiosk to be an improved, usable interface".
                            With multiple other students, we worked as a team to research, brainstorm, prototype, and improve the Metro kiosk.
                            I worked to create the Adobe XD prototype. Although this prototype is limited in the workflow, it provides a basic visualization of how we wanted the kiosk to work.
                            Throughout the design process, I acted as an user interface designer. I helped create a layout for the prototype and also kept track of usability testing. 
                            I was able to contribute to my group by calculating scores for usability testing and writing up the summary. 
                            We aimed to create a linear process that users could follow instead of having a jumbled mess of information that the user had to decipher.

                            For this poster project, I drew inspiration from David Carson and Katya Mezhibovskaya. 
                            These designers use techniques such as asymmetry, movement, and figure ground. 
                            This poster highlights my definition of design, which is <b>design being a meeting place for the past and present</b>. 
                            We pull design from past aspects and build on them, meaning that design is always growing. 
                            My poster shows this aspect by having the foreground filled by a girl in a traditional Korean dress. 
                            This then contrasts with the background which is filled with a picture that seems to be an old black and white photo. 
                            If looked at carefully, the bottom of the background has a historical site while the top of the background has modern day buildings and cars.
                            This image was created through Adobe Photoshop.
